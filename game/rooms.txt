	sleeves. He has 45-inch-long black fingernails. He smells

opening_message: You ask him why he has been holding these innocent Koreans
	in their land, not allowed to leave. He responds, hissing

	"Well, thisss isss only my REVENGE, puny human!! The Koreanssss usssed
	to think sssnakessss were evil and bit children. In actuality, all of
	the poissson sssnakesss were driven out by Emperor Timer V. Actually,

	"But, your fate will come because I will grow fangssss if you stay
	one moment longer."

	You respond, saying

	"I will stay however long you want. If you try to bite me,
	the sapphire and sword that you have hidden are in my hands."

	You take out the sword and the sapphire and the emperor gasps.
	Right, that instant, the sword and sapphire magically 
	turn into a wand which you use to cast a curse on him that his
	descendants will turn into pigs at the age of 17.
